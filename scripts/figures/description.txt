Figure 3. Phylogeny of 386 genomes of SARS-CoV-2, 253 from Trentino and 133 from GISAID. Red branches identify sequences from Trentino from samples collected in the first epidemic wave (spring 2020), while blue branches identify sequences from Trentino from the second epidemic wave (autumn 2020). Black dots mark nodes with high posterior probability (pp ≥ 80%), while gray dots mark nodes with intermediate posterior probability (50% < pp < 80%).

Supplementary Figure S4. Phylogenomic reconstruction of the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Trentino. Red branches identify the first batch of sequences from Trentino from samples collected in the first epidemic wave (Ph1; spring 2020); green branches and black branches identify Italian sequences, respectively from Lombardy or from other regions of Italy, while violet branches are used to represent sequences which are not of Italian origin. A well distinct and secondary introduction of the virus in the area of Rome is highlighted in yellow. All samples which are not coming from the Trentino batch (n=72) were downloaded from GISAID (n=212). Black dots mark nodes with high posterior probability (pp ≥ 80%), while gray dots mark nodes with intermediate posterior probability (50% < pp < 80%). A timescale at the bottom of the figure indicates the month and year of the sample.
